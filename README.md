# An experiment in Least Significant Bit Steganography in Python
Inspired by ComputerPhile

This is intended as a demonstration of LSB steganography designed to be easy to follow. It uses string representations of the binary data 
making it easier to print out steps and visualise the process. 

A work in progress
